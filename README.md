# Lambda-Library
A free library of Lambda functions for AWS. This provides an example of querying a dynamoDB database with a single-table design using metadata for a local secondary index. These are typically invoked through Lambda integration into API gateway, but some are designed to be run from the Lambda console for dev purposes as well.
